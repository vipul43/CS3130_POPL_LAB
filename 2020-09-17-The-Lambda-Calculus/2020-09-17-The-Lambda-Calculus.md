# The Lambda calculus : A small functional language

Deadline: 30st September, 2020, 23:59

We look at the following simple functional programming language whose
abstract syntax is given as follows.

```
<expr>  := variable                    -- A variable like x, y, z
        | <expr> <expr>                -- eâ‚ eâ‚‚ should mean the function eâ‚ applied on eâ‚‚ (like sml)
		| "fn" variable "=>" <expr>    -- fn x => e  means that function that takes x to e

```

Examples of programs in this language are


```
fn x => x  â€“ The indentity function
fn x y => x â€“ The const function etc.
```

Note: We will not need parenthesis in the AST but when we want to
express programs in this language as a string we will need to put
brackets to disambiguate the application order.

1. Define a type `expr` to capture this abstract syntax using ML data
   types with variables represented as strings
   ```
       type var      = string
	   datatype expr = ...
   ```

2. Write a function `fresh : string list -> string` which will produce
   a fresh variable name, i.e. given `xs : string list`, the strin
   `fresh xs` will be different from all the strings in `xs`. Hint:
   [Use Cantors diagonalisation][cantor]

3. Consider an expression like `fn x => x y`. Here `x` is a _bound
   variable_ because it occurs in the shadow of the binder `fn x =>
   ..`. However, `y` is a _free variable_. Write a functions `free :
   expr -> var list` to compute the list of free and all the
   Hint: First write down a formal definition for what is the set of
   free variable. We know that there are only three kinds of expressions

   1. A variable `x`
   2. A function application `eâ‚ eâ‚‚`
   3. An function abstraction `fn x => e`

   In each of these case what is the set of free variables ?

4. Write a function `subst : var * expr -> expr -> expr` where `subst
   (x,N) M` substitutes all _free_ occurrence of x in M with N. In
   mathematical notation it is written as `M [x:=N]`.

# Bonus Question (Ungraded)

 A _reduction_ is defined as follows : `(fn x => M) N` reduces to `M[x
 := N]`. Write functions to reduce programs in this language.  This
 code is not as simple as it appears because you need to avoid
 variable captures. Hint: Make use of the `fresh` function and bound
 variable renaming.


 Hint: Write a function `freshen : var list -> expr -> expr` which will make sure that
 all bound variables of `e` are replaced by fresh variables.


 1. freshen vs e = let vs' = all variables of e â‹ƒ vs
                       compute fresh variables from vs'
# Variable capture

Substitution can lead to _variable capture_ that has to be taken care
of. For example, consider reducing the expression `M N` where `M` is
`(fn x => fn t => x t)` and `N` is `t`, then the naive reduction
will give `fn t => t t` which is incorrect. In this case we say that
the free variable of `N` is _captured_ by the `fn t => ...`.

To avoid this capture, we need to change the bound variable `t` in the
sub-expression `(fn t => x t)` of `M` to some fresh variable, a
variable that does not occur as free in `N`. But you need to be
careful here such that you do not capture another variable in M. For
example you cannot replace `t` by `x`.

The idea therefore is as follows when performing `M [x := N]`, if `M`
is `fn t => M'` then replace t with something different `(var M' âˆª
var N)`.
